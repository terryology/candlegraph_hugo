Welcome to more information about candles than you probably ever hoped to know! I started this project as a way to use one of my hobbies – scented candles – to expand my knowledge of Excel. From there, it has grown into a full data analytics project, including the use of such tools as SQL and Tableau, both of which I’m still learning. In fact, it’s fair to say that I’m still learning about most of this, even how to best measure and analyze the data I get from burning candles. There may (read: probably will) be times when you say, “Hey wait, that’s wrong.” Please bear with me – hopefully we can learn from each other!
