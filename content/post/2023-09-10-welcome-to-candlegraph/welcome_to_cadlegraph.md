Hello, and welcome to Candlegraph! My name is Terry, and I love scented candles. They’re a great way to turn your house into a warm and inviting home. However, not all scented candles are created equal, which is the idea behind this site.

I can’t tell you exactly when it happened, but somewhere along the way I started measuring how long certain candles would burn for, and how much value I was getting from these (sometimes expensive) candles. An Excel sheet was born, and out of that, a PowerPoint presentation and Toastmasters speech entitled **Candle Burn Times: A Value Proposition**

The more people I shared my idea with, the more encouragement I got to go all in. A friend tore apart my initial ‘methodology’ and I revised and updated my measurements for 2022. In the summer I got even more serious and took a course in SQL, and now my candle readings live in databases. And as a final measure, I created this site is as a way to link everything together.

My goal with this project, aside from experiencing the aroma of many lovely candles, is to improve my methods of data collection, storage, and analysis, and I hope to share more information as I continue to develop this site. So look around, and let me know what you would like to see!

-Terry
