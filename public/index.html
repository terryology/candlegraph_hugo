        <p>Before this project started, I enjoyed scented candles as much as the next person - well, maybe a bit more than the next person - but the thought of taking measurements had not yet crossed my mind. As I&rsquo;ve mentioned, I wanted to increase my Excel skills, and candles just so happened to be there. The very first candle I measured was one from Paddywax Apothecary, probably because it was the most recent candle I had purchased. The scent was Patchouli and Tobacco, and it&rsquo;s one of the candles in my first presentation, so I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll have a separate post about it somewhere down the line. While I don&rsquo;t burn candles every single day anymore, at the time, I was deep into my new obsession and quickly went down the data-gathering rabbit hole. Soon, I had recorded information about burn times, price, and weight from five different candles, and it was time to start making some of my favorite things - charts and graphs.</p>

        <p>First, we&rsquo;ll load in our libraries. I&rsquo;m using <code>library(here)</code> on the advice of Jenny Bryan from her <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/">Project-oriented workflow</a> post on Tidyverse. This is just to organize my project into a folder in order to keep it self-contained and portable.</p>
<pre><code class="language-r"># loading libraries
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we&rsquo;ll load in the data. This comes from 4 tabs of a Google Sheets file on which I&rsquo;ve recorded my candle research. Variables include things such as the price and weight of a candle, as well as how long it burned.</p>

        <p>When I first started this project, I had no idea what I was doing, and I didn’t even know it would turn into a project. I just wanted something fun to work on while trying to figure out how adults use Excel. That is, for something other than just organizing a collection or making a schedule. It turns out that’s all a lot of people use Excel for, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Still, I wanted to take advantage of all spreadsheets have to offer, and using the data I was already gathering (but not yet recording) seemed like a good place to start. I figured that doing something fun alongside my Excel education would keep me interested and motivated, and in that I was correct. In fact it ended up growing into something much more, but in this post I want to focus on how it all began.</p>

        <p>Hello, and welcome to Candlegraph! My name is Terry, and I love scented candles. They’re a great way to turn your house into a warm and inviting home. However, not all scented candles are created equal, which is the idea behind this site.</p>
