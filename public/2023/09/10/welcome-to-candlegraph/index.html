      <p>Hello, and welcome to Candlegraph! My name is Terry, and I love scented candles. They’re a great way to turn your house into a warm and inviting home. However, not all scented candles are created equal, which is the idea behind this site.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you exactly when it happened, but somewhere along the way I started measuring how long certain candles would burn for, and how much value I was getting from these (sometimes expensive) candles. An Excel sheet was born, and out of that, a PowerPoint presentation and Toastmasters speech entitled <strong>Candle Burn Times: A Value Proposition</strong></p>
<p>The more people I shared my idea with, the more encouragement I got to go all in. A friend tore apart my initial ‘methodology’ and I revised and updated my measurements for 2022. In the summer I got even more serious and took a course in SQL, and now my candle readings live in databases. And as a final measure, I created this site is as a way to link everything together.</p>
<p>My goal with this project, aside from experiencing the aroma of many lovely candles, is to improve my methods of data collection, storage, and analysis, and I hope to share more information as I continue to develop this site. So look around, and let me know what you would like to see!</p>
<p>-Terry</p>
